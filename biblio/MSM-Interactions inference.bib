abstract = {A species' distribution and abundance are determined by abiotic conditions and biotic interactions with other species in the community. Most species distribution models correlate the occur-rence of a single species with environmental variables only, and leave out biotic interactions. To test the importance of biotic interactions on occurrence and abundance, we compared a multivariate spa-tiotemporal model of the joint abundance of two invasive insects that share a host plant, hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA; Adelges tsugae) and elongate hemlock scale (EHS; Fiorina externa), to indepen-dent models that do not account for dependence among co-occurring species. The joint model revealed that HWA responded more strongly to abiotic conditions than EHS. Additionally, HWA appeared to predispose stands to subsequent increase of EHS, but HWA abundance was not strongly dependent on EHS abundance. This study demonstrates how incorporating spatial and temporal dependence into a species distribution model can reveal the dependence of a species' abundance on other species in the community. Accounting for dependence among co-occurring species with a joint distribution model can also improve estimation of the abiotic niche for species affected by interspecific interactions.},

abstract = {1. Aprimary goal of ecology is to understand the fundamental processes underlying the geographic distributions of species. Twomajor strands of ecology – habitat modelling and community ecology – approach this problem differently.Habitat modellers often use species distributionmodels (SDMs) to quantify the relationship between species' and their environments without considering potential biotic interactions. Community ecologists, on the other hand, tend to focus on biotic interactions and, in observational studies, use co-occurrence patterns to iden- tify ecological processes. Here, we describe a joint species distribution model (JSDM) that integrates these dis- tinct observational approaches by incorporating species co-occurrence data into a SDM. 2. JSDMs estimate distributions of multiple species simultaneously and allow decomposition of species co-occurrence patterns into components describing shared environmental responses and residual patterns of co-occurrence.We provide a general description of themodel, a tutorial and code for fitting themodel in R.We demonstrate thismodelling approach using two case studies: frogs and eucalypt trees in Victoria,Australia. 3. Overall, shared environmental correlations were stronger than residual correlations for both frogs and euca- lypts, but there were cases of strong residual correlation.Frog species generally had positive residual correlations, possibly due to the fact these species occurred in similar habitats thatwere not fully described by the environmen- tal variables included in the JSDM. Eucalypt species that interbreed had similar environmental responses but had negative residual co-occurrence. One explanation is that interbreeding species may not form stable assem- blages despite having similar environmental affinities. 4. Environmental and residual correlations estimated from JSDMs can help indicate whether co-occurrence is driven by shared environmental responses or other ecological or evolutionary process (e.g. biotic interactions), or if important predictor variables are missing. JSDMs take into account the fact that distributions of species might be related to each other and thus overcome amajor limitation ofmodelling species distributions indepen- dently},

abstract = {Metacommunity theory provides an understanding of how spatial processes determine the structure and function of communities at local and regional scales. Although metacommunity theory has considered trophic dynamics in the past, it has been performed idiosyncratically with a wide selection of possible dynamics. Trophic metacommunity theory needs a synthesis of a few influential axis to simplify future predictions and tests. We propose an extension of metacommunity ecology that addresses these shortcomings by incorporating variability among trophic levels in 'spatial use properties'. We define 'spatial use properties' as a set of traits (dispersal, migration, foraging and spatial information processing) that set the spatial and temporal scales of organismal movement , and thus scales of interspecific interactions. Progress towards a synthetic predictive framework can be made by (1) documenting patterns of spatial use properties in natural food webs and (2) using theory and experiments to test how trophic structure in spatial use properties affects metacommunity dynamics.},

@article{Staniczenko2017,
abstract = {Sequences required for the expression of Cytc-2 (At4g10040), one of two cytochrome c genes from Arabidopsis thaliana, were characterized using plants transformed with deleted and mutagenized promoter fragments fused to gus. These studies indicated that a region containing a G-box and an ACGT motif is essential for expression. Mutation of the ACGT motif causes a complete loss of expression, while mutation of the G-box causes decreased expression in aerial parts and abolishes expression in roots and induction by environmental factors. Upstream located site II elements are required for maximal expression, mainly in reproductive tissues, and maximal induction by different factors. One-hybrid screenings allowed the identification of transcription factors from the bZIP and bHLH families that interact mainly with the G-box. Four of these factors were able to bind to the Cytc-2 promoter in vitro and in transactivation assays in Arabidopsis. Analysis of available microarray data indicated that the bZIP transcription factors share expression characteristics with the Cytc-2 gene, suggesting that they act as mediators of its response to tissue-specific, environmental, and metabolic conditions. Site II elements interact with a TCP family protein and may co-ordinate the expression of the Cytc-2 gene with that of other respiratory chain components. A model is proposed for the evolution of the Cytc-2 gene through the incorporation of a segment containing a G-box and an ACGT motif into an ancestral gene that contained site II elements. This may have reduced the importance of site II elements for basal expression and conferred new responses to environmental factors.},

abstract = {Cystophloroketals A−E(1−5), five new phloroglucinol−meroditerpenoid hybrids, have been isolated together with their putative biosynthetic precursor, the monocyclic meroditerpenoid 6, from the Mediterranean brown alga Cystoseira tamariscifolia. They represent the first examples of meroditerpenoids linked to a phloroglucinol through a 2,7-dioxabicyclo[3.2.1]octane moiety. The chemical structures, including absolute configurations, were elucidated on the basis of extensive spectroscopic analysis (HR-ESIMS, 1D and 2D NMR, and ECD) and TDDFT ECD calculations. Compounds 1−6 were tested for their antifouling activity against several marine colonizing species (bacteria, fungi, invertebrates, micro- and macroalgae). Compound 6 showed high potency for the inhibition of macrofoulers (invertebrates and macroalgae), while cystophloroketals B (2) and D (4) displayed strong inhibition of the germination of the two macroalgae tested and moderate antimicrobial activities (bacteria, microalgae, and fungi). n},

@article{Warton2015a,
abstract = {Technological advances have enabled a new class of multivariate models for ecology, with the potential now to specify a statistical model for abundances jointly across many taxa, to simultaneously explore interactions across taxa and the response of abundance to environmental variables. Joint models can be used for several purposes of interest to ecologists, including estimating patterns of residual correlation across taxa, ordination, multivariate inference about environmental effects and environment-by-trait interactions, accounting for missing predictors, and improving predictions in situations where one can leverage knowledge of some species to predict others. We demonstrate this by example and discuss recent computation tools and future directions. Many ecological questions require the joint analysis of abundances collected simultaneously across many taxonomic groups, and, if organisms are identified using modern tools such as metabarcoding, their number can be in the thousands.While historically such data have been analyzed using ad hoc algorithms, it is now possible to fully specify joint statistical models for abundance using multivariate extensions of generalized linear mixed models.These modern 'joint modeling' approaches allow the study of correlation patterns across taxa, at the same time as studying environmental response, to tease the two apart.Latent variable models are an especially exciting tool that has recently been used for ordination as well as for studying the factors driving co-occurrence.},
