abstract = {A species' distribution and abundance are determined by abiotic conditions and biotic interactions with other species in the community. Most species distribution models correlate the occur-rence of a single species with environmental variables only, and leave out biotic interactions. To test the importance of biotic interactions on occurrence and abundance, we compared a multivariate spa-tiotemporal model of the joint abundance of two invasive insects that share a host plant, hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA; Adelges tsugae) and elongate hemlock scale (EHS; Fiorina externa), to indepen-dent models that do not account for dependence among co-occurring species. The joint model revealed that HWA responded more strongly to abiotic conditions than EHS. Additionally, HWA appeared to predispose stands to subsequent increase of EHS, but HWA abundance was not strongly dependent on EHS abundance. This study demonstrates how incorporating spatial and temporal dependence into a species distribution model can reveal the dependence of a species' abundance on other species in the community. Accounting for dependence among co-occurring species with a joint distribution model can also improve estimation of the abiotic niche for species affected by interspecific interactions.},

abstract = {Metacommunity theory provides an understanding of how spatial processes determine the structure and function of communities at local and regional scales. Although metacommunity theory has considered trophic dynamics in the past, it has been performed idiosyncratically with a wide selection of possible dynamics. Trophic metacommunity theory needs a synthesis of a few influential axis to simplify future predictions and tests. We propose an extension of metacommunity ecology that addresses these shortcomings by incorporating variability among trophic levels in 'spatial use properties'. We define 'spatial use properties' as a set of traits (dispersal, migration, foraging and spatial information processing) that set the spatial and temporal scales of organismal movement , and thus scales of interspecific interactions. Progress towards a synthetic predictive framework can be made by (1) documenting patterns of spatial use properties in natural food webs and (2) using theory and experiments to test how trophic structure in spatial use properties affects metacommunity dynamics.},

abstract = {Sequences required for the expression of Cytc-2 (At4g10040), one of two cytochrome c genes from Arabidopsis thaliana, were characterized using plants transformed with deleted and mutagenized promoter fragments fused to gus. These studies indicated that a region containing a G-box and an ACGT motif is essential for expression. Mutation of the ACGT motif causes a complete loss of expression, while mutation of the G-box causes decreased expression in aerial parts and abolishes expression in roots and induction by environmental factors. Upstream located site II elements are required for maximal expression, mainly in reproductive tissues, and maximal induction by different factors. One-hybrid screenings allowed the identification of transcription factors from the bZIP and bHLH families that interact mainly with the G-box. Four of these factors were able to bind to the Cytc-2 promoter in vitro and in transactivation assays in Arabidopsis. Analysis of available microarray data indicated that the bZIP transcription factors share expression characteristics with the Cytc-2 gene, suggesting that they act as mediators of its response to tissue-specific, environmental, and metabolic conditions. Site II elements interact with a TCP family protein and may co-ordinate the expression of the Cytc-2 gene with that of other respiratory chain components. A model is proposed for the evolution of the Cytc-2 gene through the incorporation of a segment containing a G-box and an ACGT motif into an ancestral gene that contained site II elements. This may have reduced the importance of site II elements for basal expression and conferred new responses to environmental factors.},
