abstract = {The amperometric titration of 7{\textperiodcentered}10-5M EDTA with copper(II) was performed in an acetate buffer of pH 5.0 at the rotated platinum electrode. A pH range of 4.73 to 5.73 was used to titrate 7{\textperiodcentered}10-4M EDTA. The potentiometric titration at small constant current of 7{\textperiodcentered}10-3 to 3.5{\textperiodcentered}10-4M EDTA with copper(II) was performed in an acetate buffer of pH 5.0 at the rotated platinum electrode. {\textcopyright} 1959.},
