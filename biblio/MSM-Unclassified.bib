abstract = {We propose a Bayesian model for mixed ordinal and continuous multivariate data to evaluate a latent spatial Gaussian process. Our proposed model can be used in many contexts where mixed continuous and discrete multivariate responses are observed in an effort to quantify an unobservable continuous measurement. In our example, the latent, or unobservable measurement is wetland condition. While predicted values of the latent wetland condition variable produced by the model at each location do not hold any intrinsic value, the relative magnitudes of the wetland condition values are of interest. In addition, by including point-referenced covariates in the model, we are able to make predictions at new locations for both the latent random variable and the multivariate response. Lastly, the model produces ranks of the multivariate responses in relation to the unobserved latent random field. This is an important result as it allows us to determine which response variables are most closely correlated with the latent variable. Our approach offers an alternative to traditional indices based on best professional judgment that are frequently used in ecology. We apply our model to assess wetland condition in the North Platte and Rio Grande River Basins in Colorado. The model facilitates a comparison of wetland condition at multiple locations and ranks the importance of in-field measurements.},

abstract = {Both species and their interactions are affected by changes that occur at evolutionary time-scales, and shape both ecological communities and their phylogenetic structure. But because extent ecological community structure is contingent upon random chance, environmental filters, and local effects, it is unclear how much ecological signal local communities should retain. Here we show that, in a host–parasite system where species interactions vary substantially over a continental gradient, the ecological significance of individual interactions is maintained across different scales. Notably, this occurs despite the fact that observed community variation at the local scale frequently tends to weaken or remove community-wide phylogenetic signal. When considered in terms of the interplay between community ecology and coevolutionary theory, our results demonstrate that individual interactions are capable and indeed likely to show a consistent signature of past evolutionary history even when woven into communities that do not.

abstract = {Modern species distribution models account for spatial autocorrelation in order to obtain unbiased statistical inference on the effects of covariates, to improve the model's predictive ability through spatial interpolation, and to gain insight in the spatial processes shaping the data. Somewhat analogously, hierarchical approaches to community-level data have been developed to gain insights into community-level processes, and to improve species-level inference by borrowing information from other species that are either ecologically or phylogenetically related to the focal species. We unify spatial and community-level structures by developing spatially explicit joint species distribution models. The models utilize spatially structured latent factors to model missing covariates as well as species-to-species associations in a statistically and computationally effective manner. We illustrate that the inclusion of the spatial latent factors greatly increases the predictive performance of the modelling approach with a case study of 55 species of butterfly recorded on a 10 km x 10 km grid in Great Britain consisting of 2,609 grid cells.

abstract = {Ecological network analysis (ENA) provides a mechanistic framework for describing complex species interactions, quantifying ecosystem services, and examining the impacts of environmental change on ecosystems. In this chapter, we highlight the importance and potential of ENA in future biomonitoring programs, as current biomonitoring indicators (e.g. species richness, population abundances of targeted species) are mostly descriptive and unable to characterize the mechanisms that underpin ecosystem functioning. Measuring the robustness of multilayer networks in the long term is one way of integrating ecological metrics more generally into biomonitoring schemes to better measure biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Ecological networks are nevertheless difficult and labour-intensive to construct using conventional approaches, especially when building multilayer networks in poorly studied ecosystems (i.e. many tropical regions). Next-generation sequencing (NGS) provides unprecedented opportunities to rapidly build highly resolved species interaction networks across multiple trophic levels, but are yet to be fully exploited. We highlight the impediments to ecologists wishing to build DNA-based ecological networks and discuss some possible solutions. Machine learning and better data sharing between ecologists represent very important areas for advances in NGS-based networks. The future of network ecology is very exciting as all the tools necessary to build highly resolved multilayer networks are now within ecologists reach.},

abstract = { High-throughput sequencing (HTS) is revolutionizing environmental surveys of microbial diversity in the three domains of life by providing detailed information on which taxa are present in microbial assemblages. However, it is still unclear how the relative abundance of specific taxa gathered by HTS correlates with cell abundances. Here, we quantified the relative cell abundance of 6 picoeukaryotic taxa in 13 planktonic samples from 6 European coastal sites using epifluorescence microscopy on tyramide signal amplification-fluorescence in situ hybridization preparations. These relative abundance values were then compared with HTS data obtained in three separate molecular surveys: 454 sequencing of the V4 region of the 18S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) using DNA and RNA extracts (DNA-V4 and cDNA-V4) and Illumina sequencing of the V9 region (cDNA-V9). The microscopic and molecular signals were generally correlated, indicating that a relative increase in specific 18S rDNA was the result of a large proportion of cells in the given taxa. Despite these positive correlations, the slopes often deviated from 1, precluding a direct translation of sequences to cells. Our data highlighted clear differences depending on the nucleic acid template or the 18S rDNA region targeted. Thus, the molecular signal obtained using cDNA templates was always closer to relative cell abundances, while the V4 and V9 regions gave better results depending on the taxa. Our data support the quantitative use of HTS data but warn about considering it as a direct proxy of cell abundances.  IMPORTANCE Direct studies on marine picoeukaryotes by epifluorescence microscopy are problematic due to the lack of morphological features and due to the limited number and poor resolution of specific phylogenetic probes used in fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) routines. As a consequence, there is an increasing use of molecular methods, including high-throughput sequencing (HTS), to study marine microbial diversity. HTS can provide a detailed picture of the taxa present in a community and can reveal diversity not evident using other methods, but it is still unclear what the meaning of the sequence abundance in a given taxon is. Our aim is to investigate the correspondence between the relative HTS signal and relative cell abundances in selected picoeukaryotic taxa. Environmental sequencing provides reasonable estimates of the relative abundance of specific taxa. Better results are obtained when using RNA extracts as the templates, while the region of 18S ribosomal DNA had different influences depending on the taxa assayed. },

abstract = {The structure of ecological interactions is commonly understood through analyses of interaction networks. However, these analyses may be sensitive to sampling biases in both the interactors (the nodes of the network) and interactions (the links between nodes). These issues may affect the accuracy of empirically constructed ecological networks. We explore the properties of sampled ecological networks by simulating large-scale ecological networks with predetermined topologies, and sampling them with different mathematical procedures. Several types of modular networks were generated, intended to represent a wide variety of communities that vary in size and types of ecological interactions. We sampled these networks with different sampling designs that may be encountered in field experiments. The observed networks generated by each sampling process were analyzed with respect to number and size of components. We show that the sampling effort needed to estimate underlying network properties depends both on the sampling design and on network topology. Networks with random or scale-free modules require more complete sampling compared to networks whose modules are nested or bipartite. Overall, the structure of nested modules was the easiest to detect, regardless of sampling design. Sampling according to species degree was consistently found to be the most accurate strategy to estimate network structure. Conversely, sampling according to module results in an accurate view of certain modules, but fails to provide a global picture of the underlying network. We recommend that these findings are incorporated into the design of projects aiming to characterize large networks of species interactions in the field, to reduce sampling biases. The software scripts developed to construct and sample networks are provided for further explorations of network structure and comparisons to real interaction data.},

abstract = {One of the main limitations of artificial neural networks (ANN) is their high inability to know in an explicit way the relations established between explanatory variables (input) and dependent variables (output). This is a major reason why they are usually called ''black boxes.'' In the last few years, several methods have been proposed to assess the relative importance of each explanatory variable. Nevertheless, it has not been possible to reach a consensus on which is the best-performing method. This is largely due to the different relative importance obtained for each var-iable depending on the method used. This importance also varies with the designed network architecture and/or with the initial random weights used to train the ANN. This paper proposes a procedure that seeks to minimize these problems and provides consistency in the results obtained from different methods. Essentially, the idea is to work with a set of neural networks instead of a single one. The proposed procedure is validated using a database collected from a customer satisfaction survey, which was conducted on the public transport system of Granada (Spain) in 2007. The results show that, when each method is applied inde-pendently, the variable's importance rankings are similar and, in addition, coincide with the hierarchy established by researchers who have applied other techniques.},

Since interactions are crucial to the structure and functioning of ecological communities, we need to develop a better understanding of their spatial dynamics. Here, we apply novel numerical tools to data on species interactions, and reveal that they vary more, and in response to different climate variables, than species do. LOCATION: Eurasia. METHODS: We used a measure of Locality Contribution to Beta-Diversity to evaluate the compositional uniqueness of 51 host--parasite communities across Eurasia, using publicly available data. We measured uniqueness based on the species composition, and based on potential and realized biotic interactions. RESULTS: We show that interactions vary more, over space, than species do. In particular, we show that interactions respond to some climatic variables that have no effect on species distribution or dissimilarity. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Species interactions provide far more resolution than species occurrences alone, while still retaining all information about species occurrences. We suggest that they be put front and center in analyses of communities, especially in a biogeographic context.},

abstract = {Environmental DNA surveys are used for screening eukaryotic diversity. However, it is unclear how quantitative this approach is and to what extent results from environmental DNA studies can be used for ecological studies requiring quantitative data. Mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase (COI) is used for species-level taxonomic studies of testate amoebae and should allow assessing the community composition from environmental samples, thus bypassing biases due to morphological identification. We tested this using a COI clone library approach and focusing on the Nebela collaris complex. Comparisons with direct microscopy counts showed that the COI clone library diversity data matched the morphologically identified taxa, and that community composition estimates using the two approaches were similar. However, this correlation was improved when microscopy counts were corrected for biovolume. Higher correlation with biovolume-corrected community data suggests that COI clone library data matches the ratio of mitochondria and that within closely-related taxa the density of mitochondria per unit biovolume is approximately constant. Further developments of this metabarcoding approach including quantifying the mitochondrial density among closely-related taxa, experiments on other taxonomic groups and using high throughput sequencing should make if possible to quantitatively estimate community composition of different groups, which would be invaluable for microbial food webs studies.},

abstract = {Ecological communities are comprised of both species and the biotic relationships among them. Biotic homogenization in species composition (i.e. increased site-to-site similarity) is recognized a common consequence of global change, but less is known about how species relationships change over space and time. Does homogenization of species composition lead to homogenization of species relationships or are the dynamics of species relationships decoupled from changes in species composition? To answer this question, we used long-term resurvey data to analyze changes in plant species association patterns between the 1950s and 2000s at 266 sites distributed among three community types in Wisconsin, USA. We used species associations (quantified via local co-occurrence patterns) as a proxy for species relationships. Species pairs that co-occur more/less than expected by chance have positive/negative associations. Shifts in species associations consistently exceeded the shifts observed in species composition. Less disturbed forests of northern Wisconsin have converged somewhat in species composition but not much in species associations. In contrast, forests in central Wisconsin succeeding from pine barrens to closed-canopy forests have strongly homogenized in both species composition and species associations. More fragmented forests in southern Wisconsin also tended to converge in species composition and in the species negative associations, but their positive associations diverged over the last half century. We conclude that long-term shifts in species relationships may be decoupled from those of species composition despite being affected by similar environmental variables.},

The resulting operational taxonomic units (OTUs) can be assigned to potential taxonomic and functional identities using increasingly complete reference databases. HTS of soil eDNA is revealing a high diversity and abundance of potential eukaryovorous protists, thus challenging the paradigm of the predominantly bacterivorous function of soil phagotrophic protists (i.e. microbial loop). Using Illumina sequencing of soil eDNA and targeting the V9 region of the SSU rRNA gene, we investigated the taxonomic and functional diversities, distribution and co-occurrence patterns of soil micro-eukaryotes in three land-use categories: forests, meadows and croplands located in Switzerland. Each OTU was assigned to a broad functional category (phototrophs, phagotrophs, osmotrophs, or parasites). Total OTU richness was similar in the three land-use categories, but community composition differed significantly between forests and other land-uses. The proportion of fungal sequences (especially Basidiomycota) was highest, and phototroph (i.e. soil microalgae) sequences least abundant in forests. Seven OTUs representing phagotrophic protists, together accounting for {\textgreater}25{\%} of all phagotroph sequences, were significantly correlated to the total number of phototroph sequences, thus suggesting algivory. At least three of these OTUs corresponded to known algal predators. These results suggest that beyond plants, soil microalgae represent a functionally significant but rarely considered input of carbon in soils that should be taken into account when modelling soil nutrient cycling.},

abstract = {Understanding and forecasting species' geographic distributions in the face of global change is a central priority in biodiversity science. The existing view is that one must choose between correlative models for many species versus process-based models for few species. We suggest that opportunities exist to produce process-based range models for many species, by using hierarchical and inverse modeling to borrow strength across species, fill data gaps, fuse diverse data sets, and model across biological and spatial scales. We review the statistical ecology and population and range modeling literature, illustrating these modeling strategies in action. A variety of large, coordinated ecological datasets that can feed into these modeling solutions already exist, and we highlight organisms that seem ripe for the challenge.},
